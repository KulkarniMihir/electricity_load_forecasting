# Electricity Load Forecasting

This repository contains a project on electricity load forecasting using various machine learning techniques, including ARIMA and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) models. The aim of this project is to accurately predict future electricity demand based on historical load data.

# Introduction

Electricity load forecasting is crucial for efficient power system planning and operation. Accurate load forecasts help in optimizing the generation, distribution, and utilization of electrical power. This project explores different machine learning models to predict electricity load, focusing on the Gradient Boosting, ARIMA and GRU models.
